## IMPLEMENTATION

### Selection Criteria

- Roll for general moments (60% chance)
- Roll for character-specific if relevant characters present (40% chance)
- Prefer positive moments if crew has high strain
- Include negative moments for realism but balance
- Special relationship moments only trigger if relationships developed

### Frequency

- 1 moment per travel segment (short trips)
- 2-3 moments per long downtime (shore leave, repairs)
- Can be triggered manually during rest periods

### Display
