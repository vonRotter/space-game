# Strain System

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-03

The Strain system tracks psychological pressure on crew members throughout the journey. Each character has unique vulnerabilities, thresholds, and coping mechanisms that create meaningful character moments and relationship-dependent resolutions.

---

## Core Concepts

### What is Strain?

Strain represents cumulative psychological stress from dangerous situations, personal triggers, and ongoing mission pressure. Unlike traditional health systems, Strain:

- Is **invisible to players as numbers** - displayed through character-appropriate status descriptions
- **Accumulates slowly** through mission events
- **Reflects personality** - resilient characters look calm even under stress, vulnerable characters always seem tense
- **Requires intervention** at threshold to prevent crisis
- **Reduces through success** - critical successes, personal achievements, and bonding moments

### Core Philosophy

**"Ghost always looks stressed (it's her personality), Rex always looks calm (it's his)"**

Players see approximate Strain levels through personality-filtered status descriptions, never raw numbers. The same Strain level appears differently for each character based on their baseline personality and threshold.

---

## Strain Thresholds by Character

### Vulnerable Characters (Threshold: 15-18)
Characters who crack under pressure quickly due to past trauma or personality.

| Character | Threshold | Baseline Personality |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Ghost** | 15 | Always watchful and paranoid |
| **Johnny** | 16 | Lies more when stressed |
| **Yuki** | 18 | Oblivious optimism masks stress |

### Average Characters (Threshold: 20-22)
Typical psychological resilience with moderate stress tolerance.

| Character | Threshold | Baseline Personality |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Elena** | 20 | Obsessive focus intensifies |
| **Sarah** | 20 | Academic anxiety shows |
| **Patches** | 21 | Stimulant use increases |
| **Iris** | 22 | Corporate composure cracks |

### Resilient Characters (Threshold: 25-30)
Military training, life experience, or personality makes them extremely stress-resistant.

| Character | Threshold | Baseline Personality |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Rex** | 30 | Jokes deflect everything |
| **Wrench** | 28 | Anger replaces fear |
| **Magdalene** | 27 | Spiritual calm maintained |
| **Boom** | 26 | Enthusiasm never wavers |
| **Viktor** | 25 | Controlled and measured |

---

## Status Visibility Examples

### Ghost (Vulnerable, Threshold 15)
```
0-3:   [Tense but Managing]
4-7:   [Watchful and Wary] ⚠️
8-11:  [On Edge]
12-14: [Barely Holding Together] ⚠️⚠️
15+:   [CRISIS POINT] 🚨
```

### Rex (Resilient, Threshold 30)
```
0-7:   [Steady as a Rock]
8-15:  [Taking Extra Shifts] ⚠️
16-22: [Joking to Deflect]
23-29: ["I'm Fine" Mode] ⚠️⚠️
30+:   [CRISIS POINT] 🚨
```

**Result**: Ghost always looks stressed, Rex always looks calm, even at equivalent Strain percentages.

## How Strain Accumulates

### Base Event Strain
Standard Strain for all crew based on event danger level.

| Danger Level | Base Strain | Examples |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **Routine** | +0 | Shore leave, standard travel |
| **Low** | +1 | Minor complications, social awkwardness |
| **Medium** | +2 | Combat, dangerous exploration |
| **High** | +3 | Casualties, life-threatening crisis |
| **Critical** | +4 | Catastrophic failure, major trauma |

### Character-Specific Triggers
Additional Strain based on personal vulnerabilities.

| Trigger Type | Strain Range | Examples |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Minor Trigger** | +1-2 | Uncomfortable situation |
| **Major Trigger** | +3-5 | Direct confrontation with fear |
| **Severe Trigger** | +6-8 | Worst nightmare scenario |
| **Catastrophic** | +10+ | Personal tragedy, complete breakdown |

### Example: Medical Emergency Event

**Base Strain**: +0 (routine medical work)

**Patches (treating patient):**
- Base: +0 (his job)
- If saves patient: -2 (success)
- If critical success: -2 additional
- **Total**: -4 Strain (ends less stressed)

**Other Crew:**
- Base: +2 (crew in danger)
- If patient saved: -1 (relief)
- **Total**: +1 Strain (manageable)

**If Patient Dies:**
- Patches: +6 (medical failure)
- Close friends: +5 (grief)
- Others: +3 (loss)

---

## Reducing Strain

### Critical Success Modifiers
```
Minor Success (meet DC): +0 modifier
Good Success (exceed by 5-10): -1 Strain to roller
Critical Success (exceed by 10+): -2 to roller, -1 to all crew
```

### Mission Completion
```
Primary goal achieved: -2 Strain (all crew)
Zero casualties: -1 Strain (all crew)
Peaceful resolution: -1 Strain (all crew)
Creative solution: -1 Strain (solver)
```

### Personal Achievements
When character achieves something aligned with core motivation:

| Character | Achievement Example | Strain Reduction |

## Crisis Events (At Threshold)

When a character reaches their Strain threshold, a **mandatory crisis event** triggers. The crew must help resolve it, and the quality of resolution depends on who helps and the strength of relationships.

### Warning System
```
At 75% of Threshold: 
"[Character] seems more [personality trait] than usual..."

At 100% of Threshold:
MANDATORY EVENT - "[Character] needs help NOW"
```

### Resolution Quality Tiers

**Excellent Resolution** (Best friend/Romance helps):
- Strain: -15 to -20
- Character growth moment
- Threshold increases by +5
- Relationship deepens significantly

**Good Resolution** (Ally helps):
- Strain: -10 to -12
- Minor character growth
- Relationship improves

**Decent Resolution** (Neutral crew helps):
- Strain: -8 to -10
- Temporary relief
- Small relationship improvement

**Poor Resolution** (Alone or hostile crew):
- Strain: -5 to -8
- No growth
- Next threshold LOWERS by -5
- Strain accumulates faster

**Failed Resolution** (Ignored):
- Strain: -3
- Threshold LOWERS by -5
- Character develops unhealthy coping
- Relationship damage

## Default Coping Mechanisms

What characters do when under stress (mostly unhealthy):

| Character | Coping Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| **Elena** | Obsessive specimen documentation | Isolates from crew |
| **Wrench** | Rage maintenance (hitting things) | Damages equipment |
| **Ghost** | Disappears for hours | Crew can't find her |
| **Rex** | Takes dangerous shifts alone | Exhausts himself |
| **Sarah** | Over-theorizes everything | Decision paralysis |
| **Patches** | Stares at stim supply | Addiction worsens |
| **Magdalene** | Excessive "rituals" | Loses hours to maintenance |
| **Johnny** | Doubles down on lies | Trust erodes |
| **Yuki** | Reckless artifact handling | Triggers traps |
| **Boom** | Unnecessary demolitions | Creates problems |
| **Iris** | Enforces corporate standards | Alienates crew |
| **Viktor** | Excessive maintenance | Phantom pain worsens |

## Relationship-Based Resolution Examples

### Ghost's Strain Crisis

**Best (Viktor - Romance):**
> Viktor finds Ghost in her hidden spot. He says nothing, just sits nearby, maintaining his augmentations. After an hour, she speaks: "I keep waiting for you to sell me out." "I won't." "Everyone does eventually." "Not me." Another silence. "Why not?" "Because you're not a contract. You're Ghost." She doesn't respond, but inches closer. He doesn't move. That's enough.

**Effect**: -20 Strain, major breakthrough, threshold increases, romance deepens

**Good (Patches - Ally):**
> Patches leaves a medkit outside Ghost's door with a note: "Not asking questions. Take what you need." She finds stimulants, painkillers, and... chamomile tea? A second note: "The tea actually works better. Trust me on this one." Despite herself, she makes the tea. It does help. The next day, she leaves the empty box outside his medbay with her own note: "Thanks."

**Effect**: -12 Strain, friendship grows, quiet understanding

**Decent (Johnny - Tension):**
> Johnny finds Ghost checking the airlock for tracking devices. Again. "You know, if you keep this up, you'll find something eventually. Probably because you planted it." "Not helping." "Actually, I am. Because your paranoia is exhausting to watch. Take it from a professional liar - you're looking for betrayal so hard you'll manufacture it." She stops. Hates that he has a point. "I hate you." "Yeah, but I'm right."

**Effect**: -10 Strain, relationship stays tense, but honest moment

**Poor (Alone):**
> Ghost isolates completely, checking sensors obsessively. Eventually exhaustion forces sleep. When she wakes, everything is exactly as she left it. No one came. No one betrayed her. Yet. The paranoia fades, but the loneliness remains.

**Effect**: -5 Strain, no growth, threshold lowers next time

## Balancing Strain in Events

### Event Distribution Guidelines
```
70% of events: +0 to +2 total Strain
20% of events: +3 to +5 total Strain
10% of events: +6+ total Strain
```

### Recovery Opportunities
```
Shore leave: Every 5-7 events
Positive events: Every 3-4 events
Critical success opportunities: Most events
Character goal achievements: Regular possibilities
```

### Red Flags (Avoid These)
- ❌ Character gaining +5 Strain multiple events in a row
- ❌ Entire crew over threshold simultaneously
- ❌ No positive events for 10+ consecutive events
- ❌ Character never using their specialty
- ❌ Spiral without recovery options

### Green Flags (Aim For These)
- ✅ Mix of positive and negative Strain
- ✅ Characters achieving goals regularly
- ✅ Critical successes reducing Strain
- ✅ Crew members supporting each other
- ✅ Varied events targeting different characters

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core System
- Track Strain internally (numbers)
- Display as status descriptions
- Trigger crisis events at threshold

### Phase 2: Basic Reduction
- Critical success: -2 to roller
- Mission success: -2 to all
- Shore leave: -3 to all

### Phase 3: Character-Specific
- Personal goal achievements
- Character-specific event Strain
- Coping mechanism events

### Phase 4: Advanced
- Bonding moments
- Relationship-based resolutions
- Threshold adjustments based on growth

---

## Quick Reference: Adding Strain to Events

1. **Determine base Strain** for all crew (0-4)
2. **Identify character triggers** (+0 to +8)
3. **Add success modifiers** (-1 to -2)
4. **Include achievement opportunities** (-2 to -4)
5. **Apply mission outcome** (-2 success, +3 failure)
6. **Balance**: Could this spiral? Are there recovery opportunities?
