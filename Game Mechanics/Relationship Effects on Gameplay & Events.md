## OVERVIEW

Character relationships affect three main areas:

1. **Dialogue & Commentary** - How characters react to situations
2. **Event Outcomes** - Relationship bonuses/penalties
3. **Story Branching** - Unique events based on crew composition

---

## DIALOGUE SYSTEM EFFECTS

### Planning Phase Reactions

When the player is choosing how to approach an event, characters comment based on their relationships:

**Example: Approaching a Derelict Ship**

**Elena's Suggestion:** "We should scan for biological readings. Could be specimens."

**ALLY REACTIONS:**

- **Sarah:** "Agreed. And check for language patterns in any logs."
- **Yuki:** "Ooh, if it's old enough, might be precursor tech!"

**TENSION REACTIONS:**

- **Patches:** "Or we could just see if anyone needs medical help first?"
- **Rex:** "Or we could assume it's a trap, because it's always a trap."

**NEUTRAL REACTIONS:**

- **Ghost:** "I'll check for security systems."
- **Wrench:** "Someone's gotta make sure the airlocks work."

**Effect:** Creates personality, shows relationships, doesn't force choice

---

**Example: Negotiation Gone Wrong**

**Johnny's Action:** "Let me talk to them. I can smooth this over."

**ALLY REACTIONS:**

- **Iris:** "He's actually good at this. Let him try."
- **Patches:** "Worked before. Probably."

**TENSION REACTIONS:**

- **Ghost:** "He's going to lie and make it worse."
- **Sarah:** "Why does everything have to be manipulation with you?"

**NEUTRAL:**

- **Boom:** "If talking doesn't work, I have explosives."
- **Viktor:** "I'll cover him."

**Effect:** Shows trust (or lack of), adds tension, player decides

---

### Mid-Mission Banter

**Allies Working Together:**

**Wrench + Boom fixing something explosive:**

- Wrench: "Don't blow us up."
- Boom: "I'm offended you think I would."
- Wrench: "You literally did that last month."
- Boom: "That was different!"

**Ghost + Viktor on infiltration:**

- (Mostly silence)
- Viktor: _hand signal_
- Ghost: _acknowledges_
- (Perfect coordination without words)

**Elena + Sarah studying alien artifact:**

- Elena: "The cellular structure is unlike anything—"
- Sarah: "—and the grammar in these symbols suggests—"
- Elena: "—a collective consciousness probably—"
- Sarah: "—exactly what I was thinking!"
- Rex: "Can you two please focus on not dying?"

---

**Rivals Working Together:**

**Wrench + Rex during crisis:**

- Rex: "I need you to fix the—"
- Wrench: "Already on it."
- Rex: "I wasn't finished—"
- Wrench: "Don't need you to be."
- Rex: "Insufferable."
- Wrench: "Bossy."
- (Both doing their jobs competently despite bickering)

**Elena + Patches treating alien:**

- Elena: "We need to follow proper xenobiological protocols—"
- Patches: "It's dying, we need to act now—"
- Elena: "Without baseline readings we could kill it—"
- Patches: "Not acting will definitely kill it—"
- (They argue while both working to save it)

**Effect:** Shows they can work together despite tensions

---

### Success/Failure Reactions

**On Success:**

**Allies congratulate each other:**

- Elena: "Your translation was perfect, Sarah!"
- Sarah: "Your biological analysis made it possible!"

**Rivals give grudging respect:**

- Rex: "Not bad, Wrench."
- Wrench: "Don't get used to compliments, old man."

**On Failure:**

**Allies defend each other:**

- Rex: "It wasn't Yuki's fault. The trap was undetectable."
- Yuki: "No, Rex is right, I should have been more careful."

**Rivals blame (but not cruelly):**

- Ghost: "I told you not to trust him."
- Johnny: "How was I supposed to know he was lying?"
- Ghost: "Because everyone is always lying."

---

## MECHANICAL EFFECTS

---

## ROMANCE SYSTEM (OPTIONAL)

### Implementation Guidelines

**How It Develops:**

1. Multiple missions together build respect
2. Specific events trigger deeper conversations
3. Player chooses dialogue that encourages or discourages
4. Relationship status checked before proceeding
5. Can fail at any stage
6. Always optional, never forced

---

### EXAMPLE: Ghost + Viktor Romance Path

**Stage 1: Professional Respect (Missions 1-5)**

- Working together effectively
- Minimal personal dialogue
- Both recognize other's competence

**Stage 2: Understanding (Mission 6-10)**

- **Event triggers:** One saves the other
- Begin having real conversations
- Discuss trauma (carefully, maturely)
- Player dialogue choices matter

**Example Conversation:**

- Viktor: "Do you ever feel like... less?"
- Ghost: "Less than what?"
- Viktor: "Than you were. Before."
- Ghost: "I feel like more. More paranoid. More alive. More... here."
- Viktor: "I'm not sure what I feel."
- **Player Choice:**
    1. [Encouraging] "You're still human where it counts."
    2. [Understanding] "You don't have to figure it out now."
    3. [Deflecting] "We should focus on the mission."

**Stage 3: Trust (Mission 11-15)**

- Small moments of vulnerability
- Sharing backstory
- Protecting each other
- Non-romantic physical comfort (helping with injuries, etc.)

**Stage 4: Possibility (Mission 16+)**

- **Event triggers:** Quiet moment after intense danger
- Optional dialogue acknowledging feelings
- Player can accept, decline, or defer
- If accepted, relationship begins
- If declined, they remain close friends
- If deferred, opportunity comes again later

**Example Scene:**

- Ghost: "You know I don't trust anyone."
- Viktor: "I know."
- Ghost: "But I trust you."
- Viktor: "..."
- **Player Choice:**
    1. [Accept] "I trust you too."
    2. [Decline] "I value our friendship."
    3. [Defer] "Let's survive this first."

---

**Important:**

- Develops slowly over many missions
- Based on shared experiences
- Player must actively choose it
- Can end at any time
- Doesn't provide mechanical benefits
- Mature, respectful portrayal
- Emphasizes emotional connection
- Never the main plot

---

### Why These Relationships Work

- Both have trauma
- Both rebuilt themselves
- Both understand loss of control
- Both know what it's like to be used

**Johnny + Iris:**

- Both from corporate world
