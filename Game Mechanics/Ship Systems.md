# Ship Systems

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-06

**Philosophy:** Ship systems gate content, reduce difficulty, and create strategic choices. They help specialists excel but don't replace skill.

## Core Mechanics

### Two-Layer Customization

Ship customization works on two distinct layers:

**1. Crew Modifications (Free/Automatic)**
- Added when crew members join
- Reflects their expertise and personality
- No Resource cost
- Examples: Elena adds bio-lab, Wrench upgrades engineering bay, Ghost adds stealth systems

**2. Ship Systems (Purchased)**
- Equipment modules bought with Resources
- Provide difficulty reduction or enable special actions
- Limited by upgrade slots (5 base slots)
- Examples: Quantum Stabilizers, Bio-Containment Lab, Enhanced Sensors

### Three System Tiers

**ENABLING (Required)**
- Action completely unavailable without this system
- Shows as missing from action list
- Example: "Navigate dimensional rift" requires Dimensional Stabilizers - without them, option doesn't exist

**REDUCING (Recommended)**
- Action available, but difficulty reduced by 1-2 tiers with system
- Without system: Very Hard (11+)
- With system: Hard (9+) or Medium (7+)
- Example: "Hack ancient encryption" is Very Hard normally, Hard with Cryptographic Suite

**UNLOCKING (Conditional)**
- Action becomes available only if system present
- Bonus opportunities, not core paths
- Example: "Extract genetic data" only appears with Gene Sequencer

### Difficulty Reduction Scale

**Standard Reduction:** 1 tier (most common)
- Very Hard (11+) → Hard (9+)
- Hard (9+) → Medium (7+)
- Medium (7+) → Easy (5+)

**Major Reduction:** 2 tiers (expensive, specialized systems)
- Very Hard (11+) → Medium (7+)
- Hard (9+) → Easy (5+)

**Systems never reduce below Easy (5+)**

## Fuel & Resource Management

### Fuel Consumption by Hull

| Hull Type | Fuel per Jump |
|-----------|---------------|
| Scout | 1 unit |
| Research | 1.5 units |
| Freighter | 2 units |
| Armed Transport | 2 units |

**Modifiers**:
- Efficient Systems (Magdalene): -20% consumption
- Enhanced Engines (Wrench): +20% consumption, +speed

### Resource Tracking
Players track:
- **Resources**: Abstract currency (money, favors, salvage, connections)
- **Fuel**: Jump capability
- **Hull**: Ship structural integrity
- **Reputation**: Affects port access and prices

## Integration Example

**Academic Scout: "The Beacon"**

**Base**: Scout Hull (80 HP, High Speed, Low Cargo)

**Crew Modifications (Free)**:
- Elena: Bio-lab, Specimen chambers, Emergency medical
- Sarah: Translation computers, Linguistic AI, Communications
- Magdalene: Chapel, Blessed systems (+10% efficiency)

**Purchased Systems (7 Resources, 4 slots used)**:
- Bio-Containment Lab (3R, 2 slots) - Enables safe xenobiology
- Translation Matrix (2R, 1 slot) - Reduces alien communication by 1 tier
- Enhanced Sensors (2R, 1 slot) - Reduces scanning checks by 1 tier

**Synergy Example**:
Elena (+3 Science) attempting xenobiology at Very Hard (11+):
- Bio-lab (crew mod) enables xenobiology work
- Bio-Containment (purchased) reduces difficulty by 1 tier → Hard (9+)
- Roll: 2d6 + 3 vs. 9+ = needs 6+ on dice (72% success)

---

## Strategic Considerations

### Resource Allocation Decisions

**Specialization vs Versatility**:
- Quantum Stabilizers (4R, 3 slots) - Expensive but opens entire event type
- Enhanced Sensors (2R, 1 slot) - Cheap but only helps, doesn't enable

**Preparation for Expected Events**:
- Exploring unknown space → Enhanced Sensors, Quantum Stabilizers
- Scientific mission → Advanced Lab, Bio-Containment
- Diplomatic mission → Translation Matrix, Communications Array

**Compensating for Crew Weaknesses**:
- Without Patches → Need to buy Advanced Medical Bay (3R)
- Without Wrench → Engineering repairs much harder
- Without Elena → Limited scientific analysis capability

### System Requirements Create Preparation Choices

**Missing Bio-Containment at Garden Ship**:
- Can still complete event
- Just miss sample collection opportunity

**Missing Quantum Stabilizers at Probability Storm**:
- Stuck with dangerous "Emergency Jump" option
- Much higher difficulty

**Missing Gravitational Compensators at Sleeper in Star**:
- Cannot attempt close approach at all
- Option locked out entirely

---

## Ship Transformations

The same scout hull becomes different ships with different crews:

**"The Whisper" - Criminal Crew**
- Ghost + Patches + Johnny
- Stealth systems, hidden cargo, encrypted comms
- Perfect for smuggling and espionage

**"The Beacon" - Academic Crew**
- Elena + Sarah + Magdalene
- Bio-lab, translation suite, blessed systems
- Excellent for first contact and research

**"The Comet" - Military Crew**
- Rex + Viktor + Wrench
- Enhanced engines, weapons, armor
- Fast combat vessel
